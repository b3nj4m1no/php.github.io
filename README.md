# portfolioCMS
Bootstrap portfolio web site with admin panel. PHP, MySQL. Simple setup.
Uses Bootstrap Freelancer Theme for the front end. http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/
Admin panel was built using SB Admin theme http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/

In general, the code and database is really simple. Implementing the site on your own host/server is also simple.

Enjoy!
